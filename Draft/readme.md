<h1>QUick SUmmary:
Let me introduce a new app. It’s called ScanMe. This will hit UN target for Health and Well-being. We want to solve problems like when we go to grocery shopping, We don’t know which one to buy. They looked exactly the same for us. So we come up with this app, we want to analyze ingredients from food or any items with material lists. So we can help shoppers make the decision.

ScanMe is really easy to use. First, we grab the item. We have a Doritos here. Take a picture! You get an alert says “score Calculated”. You click view, then this will direct us to the ScoreScreen. You would see the picture you took on the top, then our system analyze the nutrition facts from the picture you just took. The system will generate the score for you.

And if you are interested to know why you get the score lower or higher than you expect. You would want to click this button. The button here will tell you one critical reason why you receive this score for this item. The whole idea is we want to simplify the information for users. We found that if you care about your health, the professional terms from ingredients lists usually overwhelms public. And the thing is we don’t have time to type each ingredient or material individually on the internet just for this one item.

After we have the current score. We might want to see the previous scores. Click history on the bottom navigation bar here. This is cute! Simply refresh the page. Then, you get the picture you just took! If you want to know the detail. Simply click the picture or the score. This will bring you back to the score screen to see detail information. This app is easy to use, and a reliable partner when you are of two minds.
